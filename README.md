 # django-dayta

 A simple replacement to XLS as a database, initially developed for the internal purposes of [The Beachfront Club](http://www.thebeachfrontclub.com).

 Requires a [mongo](http://www.mongodb.org) database server.

 The project is very basic at the time but may be improved with time. For the first version, my first priority was to get something up and running in a couple of hours.
 It works, but it hasn't yet been tested with non trivial amounts of data.
